# Viewer-OpenGL
A 3d scene viewer in C with OpenGL

Will support 3 axis camera movement, camera look around, zoom, and scene rotation.

This project is a test for basic viewing functionality that will be present in my differential equation viewer program Chaotic Sandbox, and improved n-body simulation Astronomical N Body Sim (V2?).
